**About the Project:**

The Loan Servicing Platform is designed for the loan approval processes of banks, retail stores, and leasing companies that offer cash or non-cash loans. This BPM solution automates the loan approval processes for these institutions, providing customer risk analyses using a sophisticated risk scoring model.

The system enhances process duration and quality with its checklists and auto-reject rules, leading to increased customer satisfaction. It detects unwanted and risky customers, provides detailed information about customers with its loan history module, and allows for the attachment of customer documents and comments, preventing time and money loss for the company.

Our solution, the Loan Origination Software, is especially targeted at retailers and loan firms. The project involved designing and implementing the entire database and developing a web-based application. Both the back-end and front-end development were done using the ASP.Net framework (C#) and MS SQL Server. The MVP was launched after approximately one year of development.
